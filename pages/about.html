<em class="o">O</em>ur Luigi's Restaurant is family operated - an achievement of which we are 
very proud.
<br /><br />

<em class="o">W</em>e are also proud to offer you meals prepared by "Art Culinaria" - the art of
cooking from a by gone era. French, Italian and English chefs from the feudal
days created many wonderful recipes which still stand as master pieces in our
culinary library.
<br /><br />

<em class="o">T</em>oday's fast food establishments take away the mystique of the chef's art in
the preparation of food. We, at LUIGI'S, preserve this mystique and prepare our 
foods in the old-fashioned way, at the same time offering a contemporary
atmosphere with prompt service meeting today's needs.
<br /><br />

<em class="o">N</em>eedless to say, pizza originated in Napoli (as did spaghetti) and we also
specialize in a delicious variation from Sicily, Ravioli is from Rome and many 
other favorite dishes originated in the Italian country sides. Every day we offer
you special dishes so that you may have the opportunity to taste and enjoy a 
large selection of good Italian Food.
<br /><br />

<em class="o">L</em>et us make your meal a "LUIGI'S MEAL" Every day!
